## Introduction

The **Customers Management System** is a software solution designed to streamline and simplify the management of customer data and their credit limits. This system was created to address the need for efficiently tracking customer information, monitoring credit limits, and making adjustments when necessary. My project aims to provide a user-friendly and robust tool for businesses and organizations to manage their customer data effectively.

## Key Features

1. **Customer Data Management**:
   - The system allows for the storage and organization of customer data, including names, contact details, and credit limits.
   - Customers are organized in a binary search tree, making it easy to access and manage their information.

2. **Credit Limit Monitoring**:
   - The system can monitor and track customer credit limits to ensure they are not exceeded.
   - It can count and identify customers with credit limits above a specified amount.

3. **Credit Limit Adjustment**:
   - Users can adjust customer credit limits as needed, updating them with additional credit or decreasing them as required.

4. **Customer Filtering**:
   - The system can quickly filter and identify customers with credit limits above a specified amount, providing an overview of high-limit customers.

5. **Charges and Payments**:
   - The system keeps records of customer charges and payments, ensuring that credit limits are accurately maintained based on transactions.

These features reflect the capabilities of your "Customers Management System." Users can effectively manage customer data, monitor credit limits, and make necessary adjustments using this system.
